# Preface

Programming is awesome, making games is awesome. Putting them together gives you the best of both worlds. This is the course material for [ClickToStart](http://www.clicktostart.org/)'s Introductory Programming course. It's designed to give a gentle introduction to programming with a language that's easy to pick up. Creating a game is rewarding but it is no easy feat! This material should help you approach your problems of varying size and difficulty.

If you have previous programming experience you would probably find this book easy, that's fine. Ther are lots of tutorials and guides to give you in-depth coverage of the Python language. In that case the game development content would be of interest to you.

## A Note on Style

As is common with many programming books, code and commands are usually highlighted in a block. To get the most out of the content, you're encouraged to write the code instead of copying and pasting. It'll do wonders for your memory.
