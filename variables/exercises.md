1. Create a variable `long_hair`. If your hair is long set it to `True`, otherwise set it to `False`. And remember, if you bought your hair it's yours! Don't let anyone tell you different.
2. Create a variable called `goat_music` and that holds your favourite song. Using either string concatenation or the format function, print a message saying that the song in `goat_music` is the greatest song of all time. E.g. if `goat_music = "Yellow by Coldplay"` then print "Yellow by Coldplay is the Greatest Song of All Time".
3. Let's start with two variables: `wheels_on_bike = 2` and `wheels_on_car = 4`. Create a variable called `total_wheels` that contains the sum of the two previous variables.
4. Create 3 variables `mysterious_question`, `simulation` and `the_answer_to_everything`. `the_answer_to_everything` should be equal to `mysterious_question` + `simulation`. Give `mysterious_question` and `simulation` 2 numerical values that would make `the_answer_to_everything` equal to 42. Print `the_answer_to_everything` to confirm.
5. Create 3 variables for a triangle: `side1`, `side2` and `side3`. Assign them values of 3, 4 and 5 respectively. What is the perimeter of this triangle? This triangle is a right triangle, with `side1` and `side2` as the base and height. Can you create a variable and store its area?
