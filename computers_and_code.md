# Computers and Code

When you're programming, you're giving the computer instructions on what to do.
Let's cover some basic concepts of computing.

Computers are electronic devices which can receive data through input, process
that data into information, stores and provides the output to the user.
Computers come in different sizes, types and fit different needs (think of a
laptop, tablet, cellphone, game console, etc). In any case, they all do the same
things: retrieve, process and store data.

If in your free time you open up any of your computing devices at home, you're
bound to find some similar components (Note: this is not encouragement to go
home and open up things... unless you can put it back together of course):

* Motherboard - This is the circuit that connects every component to each other.
    It allows for communication between the various parts of a computer
* CPU - Central Process Unit is commonly referred to as the brain of the
    computer. This component handles the majority of data processing.
* RAM - Random Access Memory is short-term memory used when your computer is
    processing data. It's best described as a desk for work: the more space you
    have, the more things you can do on the desk.
* Storage - in contrast to RAM, this is long-term memory not so much used for
    processing but for more keeping and retrieving data. For large computers
    this would take the form of a hard drive but it can also be as small as an
    SD Card.

There are of course many other components but these above are the essentials.

## I/O

It's easy to determine whether a device is an input device or an output device
based on what it's doing? Does it provide the computer with information? A
microphone does. So does a mouse (where you'd like to move the cursor), a
keyboard press, a touch on the screen, the button that controls the volume. If
you're trying to determine whether something is an output device, ask does it
gives the user information? A screen shows you what's happening with your OS
and application, a speaker gives the user sound from a file or stream, the
printer gives you a tangible document or photo. Few things in the world live as
absolutes, there are devices that are both like headphone set with microphones
commonly used in gaming or a touch screen on your smartphone.
