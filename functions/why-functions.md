# Why Functions

Functions are a great tool for us for the following reason (and more):

* Breaks down the code into smaller parts
    * Makes it easier to solve a problem when writing code, and easier to learn when reading code
* Code reusability
    * Once we define a function and it works, we just need to call the function to get the results. This way we don't have to copy and paste code when want to do a task in multiple places
* Keeps unnecessary details away from developer
    * Let's say you wrote a function that converts your weight from lbs to kg. If I were to use your function, I'll just call the function in one line. I don't need to see how you coded that function, by being able to call it I can just focus on my code and not think about yours
