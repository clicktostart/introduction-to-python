# Installing Python

If you have a modern Linux distribution or macOS, then you probably have Python
3 setup already. Open the Terminal and enter python3 to see it up and running.
If you don't then the steps for Windows will generally work for you too, just
that you'll use the Terminal instead of Powershell.

Download the installer from the python website:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - choosing the Python 3 version. The
instructions are straightforward for each installer, follow your heart and go
with the flow.

Now with either the Command Line or PowerShell, run the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

For those on *nix systems, you do this in Terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Expect to see some output like this:

```
Python 3.7.0
```
