# Data Structures

We know how to use variables to store values. And so far our examples have been
pretty small and well contained. What if we need to store 1,000 sets of data...
are we really going to make 1,000 variables? We should never have to. Python
and other programming languages caters for this and for other scenarios with a
variety of **data structures** - objects for storing data in a computer
in an organised fashion.
